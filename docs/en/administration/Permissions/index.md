SCM-Manager knows three different types of repository permissions:

Type | Description
----- | ----------
READ | The user is able to read
WRITE | The user is able to read and write
OWNER | The user is able to read, write and to manager permissions

Repository permissions can be assigned to users and groups. The permissions can be assigned
to only one repository or to each repository. Administrators have owner permissions on every repository.

### Repository permissions

Repository permissions can be managed by administrators and by repository owners. 
The permissions can be managed on the permission tab of each repository.
